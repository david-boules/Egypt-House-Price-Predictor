# Egypt House Price Predictor

### About the Project
In this project, we built a Machine Learning model to predict house prices in Egypt.

### Approach
- Conducted rigorous data cleaning procedures, including handling missing values and data inconsistencies
- Underwent exploratory data analysis to identify features that have an effect on a property's price and examined correlations between features
- Performed feature engineering to correctly format the data for a machine learning model
- Created multiple machine learning models and used evaluation metrics such as RMSE and R^2
- Utilized hyperparameter tuning to improve model accuracy
